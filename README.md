# Netflix-Movies and TV shows data analysis using SQL
## Overview
This project centers around analyzing Netflix’s Movies and TV Shows dataset, leveraging the power of SQL for data exploration and insight generation. The dataset contains information about Netflix's extensive content library, including attributes such as titles, genres, release years, ratings, and more. By performing SQL queries, the project aims to uncover patterns and trends, offering a deeper understanding of 
Netflix’s content distribution and evolution over time.

The  primary  focus  of  the  analysis  is  to  answer  specific  business  and  research-oriented questions. These include identifying the balance between movies and TV shows, the most common ratings, the longest movie on the platform, and trends in content additions over recent years. Such insights help shed light on content preferences, production trends, and market strategies.
## Objective
- To explore Netflix's content catalog and extract meaningful insights.
- To answer specific questions related to the content types, ratings, trends, and more using SQL queries.
- To demonstrate proficiency in SQL by formulating and executing queries to derive actionable information from the dataset.
